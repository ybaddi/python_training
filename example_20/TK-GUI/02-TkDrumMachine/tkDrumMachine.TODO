 ☐ 3. Add a tempo scale to your drum machine, which lets the user change the tempo of the beats using a slider
 ☐ 4. Add volume control for each drum sample, allowing the user to change the volume individually for each drum sample.
 ☐ 5. Add a mute button for each drum sample. If the Checkbutton is clicked for a given drum sample, the sound is not played for that row. This way, a user can stop a complete row from playing without changing the patterns in that row.
 ☐ 6. Add a time clock to your drum machine, which displays the time elapsed since the last press of the play button.
 Todo #3 , #4 and #5 can be resolved by the Module pymedia itself.
